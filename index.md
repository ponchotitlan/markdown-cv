## Professional experience

`2021 - now`

Relevant projects:

1) Firewall Automation as a Service platform

Creation of a full-stack platform for the automated provisioning of security policies in the customer's Data Center.

I fulfilled the role of Developer Lead for the southbound interface (devices configurations check, commit and rollback), including setup of development environment, DevOps pipeline for automated testing and artefact generation, code reviews, PR managing, pair troubleshooting and Day2 support. Our customer was able to drastically reduce the time for manual configuration of security policies in their brownfield network, as well as to mitigate human errors and discrepancies; everything while performing persona-based, end-to-end management of the requests. Technologies used: Python, NETCONF and RESTCONF protocols, Robot Framework for testing, Jenkins for pipeline, Docker for staging environments, Redis and PostgreSQL databases, Github SCM.
